Take a look at the [online showcase](http://potree.org/wp/demo/)

## Getting Started
1. Deploy potree on a webserver.
2. Open one of the demos in the examples directory. <br>
Potree pages must run on a webserver so the url
should be something like "localhost/potree/examples/lion.html". URLs starting with "file:///" will not work.

For more details, read the [Getting Started Section](./docs/getting_started.md)

## Convert Your Own Pointclouds
Use the [PotreeConverter](https://github.com/potree/PotreeConverter) to convert your own point clouds into the potree format.
